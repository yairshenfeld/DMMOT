Code for the article  ``A dynamical formulation of multi-marginal optimal transport" (Brendan Pass, Yair Shenfeld) https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22494.

Implementation in Julia of the primal-dual proximal splitting algorithm for the (regularized) dynamical multi-marginal optimal transport problem.  Running  generate_figures.jl generates the figures in the paper.

Acknowledgments. This code is based on the code of Hugo Lavenant https://github.com/HugoLav/RegUnOT.
